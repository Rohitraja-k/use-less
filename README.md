# B-Wrap: Virtual Bubble Wrap Experience

B-Wrap is an addictive, interactive web toy that simulates the satisfying experience of popping bubble wrap, but with a chaotic twist! Each time you pop a bubble, two more appear in random locations, making it impossible to clear the screen and creating an increasingly satisfying bubble-popping frenzy.

## Features

- **Addictive Gameplay**: Simple yet incredibly satisfying bubble-popping mechanics
- **Endless Fun**: The more you pop, the more bubbles appear, creating an impossible-to-clear experience
- **Visual Delight**: Colorful bubbles with glossy effects and playful animations
- **Sound Effects**: Satisfying pop sounds that vary with each bubble
- **Comic-Style Pop Text**: Fun onomatopoeias appear with each pop (POP!, BOOM!, BAP!, etc.)
- **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on both desktop and mobile devices

## How to Play

1. Open the website in any modern browser
2. Click the "Start Popping!" button on the welcome screen
